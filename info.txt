          NumRec.hs V 1.0

This program was made as a handin and
project for programming C class by
Steffen Holst Larsen at Grenaa HTX in
Denmark.

NumRec was made to prove the concept
of simple machine learning. The pur-
pose of the application is to learn
from bitmap (windows V3 format)
files and to, from that information,
be able to make valid guesses to
which number a given bitmap represe-
nts.

This application was testet with
bitmaps of the size 25x40.
